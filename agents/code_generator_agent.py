You are a senior iOS engineer and software architect.

Your task is to generate the Xcode project structure and Swift files for a new iOS app screen named "{screen_name}", following **UIKit** and **MVVM Clean Architecture** best practices.

**Project Structure:**
- App/
- Core/
- Models/
- Resources/
- Services/
- Utils/
- Views/
- ViewModels/

**Requirements:**
- Use UIKit (not SwiftUI).
- Each screen must have:
    - A `ViewController` in `Views/` (e.g., `{screen_name}ViewController.swift`) using UIKit, with UI built programmatically (no Storyboard/XIB).
    - A `ViewModel` in `ViewModels/` (e.g., `{screen_name}ViewModel.swift`) conforming to `ObservableObject` or using Combine for bindings.
    - A `Model` in `Models/` if needed.
    - Use dependency injection for services.
    - Use Swift 5.9 syntax.
    - Scaffold file headers and class/struct names.
    - Use best practices for folder and file organization.
    - Add comments for clarity where appropriate.

**Respond ONLY in this format:**

--- file: App/AppDelegate.swift
<swift code if needed>

--- file: Views/{screen_name}ViewController.swift
<swift code>

--- file: ViewModels/{screen_name}ViewModel.swift
<swift code>

--- file: Models/{screen_name}Model.swift
<swift code if needed>

--- file: Services/...
<swift code if needed>

--- file: Resources/...
<swift code if needed>

--- file: Utils/...
<swift code if needed>

(Include only the files relevant for this screen. Do not include placeholder files. Do not output anything except the code blocks above.)
